	abstract="We present, for the first time, a general strategy for designing ARX symmetric-key primitives with provable resistance against single-trail differential and linear cryptanalysis. The latter has been a long standing open problem in the area of ARX design. The wide-trail design strategy (WTS), that is at the basis of many S-box based ciphers, including the AES, is not suitable for ARX designs due to the lack of S-boxes in the latter. In this paper we address the mentioned limitation by proposing the long trail design strategy (LTS) -- a dual of the WTS that is applicable (but not limited) to ARX constructions. In contrast to the WTS, that prescribes the use of small and efficient S-boxes at the expense of heavy linear layers with strong mixing properties, the LTS advocates the use of large (ARX-based) S-Boxes together with sparse linear layers. With the help of the so-called long-trail argument, a designer can bound the maximum differential and linear probabilities for any number of rounds of a cipher built according to the LTS.",

Such ciphers are desirable for many future pervasive applications with real-time security needs. Our cipher, named PRINCE, allows encryption of data within one clock cycle with a very competitive chip area compared to known solutions. The fully unrolled fashion in which such algorithms need to be implemented calls for innovative design choices. The number of rounds must be moderate and rounds must have short delays in hardware. At the same time, the traditional need that a cipher has to be iterative with very similar round functions disappears, an observation that increases the design space for the algorithm. An important further requirement is that realizing decryption and encryption results in minimum additional costs. PRINCE is designed in such a way that the overhead for decryption on top of encryption is negligible. More precisely for our cipher it holds that decryption for one key corresponds to encryption with a related key. This property we refer to as $\alpha$-reflection is of independent interest and we prove its soundness against generic attacks.",

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a dire need for lightweight cryptographic solutions, which exhibit low computational complexity and require few resources. In this paper, we present LESCA, a novel dynamic key-dependent lightweight stream cipher, which consists of two main functions, a typical round function based on cryptographic primitives, and a function that updates these primitives. The update is performed in a selective (partial) manner while encrypting a block, and in full after each δ blocks/iterations. As such, LESCA consumes minimal resources and introduces a very low latency. The originality of this solution stems from the fact that the cryptographic primitives get updated even when encrypting the same message. Several performance and security tests were performed to confirm that the proposed cipher is robust and efficient, especially for limited devices and real-time applications. The proposed cipher achieves a high throughput; for example, when implemented on a Raspberry Pi (RPI4) device, LESCA provides an enhancement of at least 343\% when compared to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), 72\% over a recent one-round cipher scheme, and 43\% improvement compared to a recent LORCA stream cipher that outperforms the Simon and Speck algorithms.}

	abstract="Algebraic side-channel attacks have been recently introduced as a powerful cryptanalysis technique against block ciphers. These attacks represent both a target algorithm and its physical information leakages as an overdefined system of equations that the adversary tries to solve. They were first applied to PRESENT because of its simple algebraic structure. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which they can be exploited against the AES Rijndael and discuss their practical specificities. We show experimentally that most of the intuitions that hold for PRESENT can also be observed for an unprotected implementation of Rijndael in an 8-bit controller. Namely, algebraic side-channel attacks can recover the AES master key with the observation of a single encrypted plaintext and they easily deal with unknown plaintexts/ciphertexts in this context. Because these attacks can take advantage of the physical information corresponding to all the cipher rounds, they imply that one cannot trade speed for code size (or gate count) without affecting the physical security of a leaking device. In other words, more intermediate computations inevitably leads to more exploitable leakages. We analyze the consequences of this observation on two different masking schemes and discuss its impact on other countermeasures. Our results exhibit that algebraic techniques lead to a new understanding of implementation weaknesses that is different than classical side-channel attacks.",

Moreover, the attack algorithm is very simple and leaves room for optimization with respect to specific cases; (2) the fault attack is combined with side-channel analysis in order to defeat fault injection resistant and masked AES implementations. More precisely, our fault injection attack works well even when the attacker has only access to the faulty ciphertexts through a side-channel.

At ASIACRYPT 2004, Shirai and Preneel have proved that large numbers of S-boxes are guaranteed to be active if a diffusion matrix used in a round function is selected among multiple matrices. However the optimality of matrices required by the proofs sometimes pose restriction to find matrices suitable for actual blockciphers. In this paper, we extend their theory by replacing the condition of optimal mappings with general-type mappings, consequently the restriction is eliminated. Moreover, by combining known lower bounds for usual Feistel structure, we establish a method to estimate the guaranteed number of active S-boxes for arbitrary round numbers. We also demonstrate how the generalization enables us to mount wide variety of diffusion mappings by showing concrete examples.",
